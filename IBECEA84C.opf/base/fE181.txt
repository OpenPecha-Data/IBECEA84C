Benedictory Verses for Pramāṇavārttika[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.This treatise is like an eye for all living beings.Through the path of reasoning[2]
it revealsThe meaning of all the Buddha’s Words and the commentaries upon them,And it establishes
the authentic purity of the Teacher too.

This fine work, authored by the universally victorious Dharmakīrti,Elucidates the meaning of
the Compendium of Valid Cognition (Pramāṇasamuccaya),Which Sthiracakra[3] urged Dignāga to
compose.

The brilliance of this work compels the tīrthikasTo scurry to their gloomy hovels below ground,And
establishes the great victory banner of the Sage’s teachingsAt the summit of the world—such
is the power of this treatise.

Since would-be scholars must, therefore, consult this,And, through the light of Mañjughoṣa’s
blessings,Develop intelligence in the ways of the Dharma,[4]This dharmic gift has been produced
through the miracle of printing.May all the positivity that has thereby been acquiredBe
dedicated to the expansion of the Sugata’s teachings.

Throughout all our lives to come,[5] may we follow the authentic TeacherAnd gain mastery of
the fourfold knowledge.[6]

The very one who carried out this pure deed made this prayer of aspiration. May virtue and excellence
reign supreme! Sarva maṅgalam. Śubhaṃ.
